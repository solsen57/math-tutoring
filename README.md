# math-tutoring

This is a collection of code I've created from the lessons I go over in my tutoring practice (primarily 8th grade mathematics).

So far there is: a quadratic formula solver, which calculates the roots of the equation and guides students on how to solve for them, a matrix determinant solver, a vertex form solver, which takes the vertex and reference point of a parabola and calculates the quadratic equation and other descriptors
  
Working on: system of linear equations solver - specifically if it cannot be converted to matrix form on paper
